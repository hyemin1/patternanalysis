task 4: use code from task 3 and find the optimal windows size h
  - use a fixed sample size and generate racoon samples like in task 3.
  - recontruct the image with the Parzen Window Estimator and different window sizes h
  - evaluate and quantify how well this worked for a certain window size h
  - try out different window sizes and find the optimal value
  - want to check: does h depend so sample size => possibly no, but we want to test it.
